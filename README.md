# Behavioural Code and Data
This repistory provides the code and behaviour for the behavioural analysis for the project, "Individual risk attitudes arise from noise in neurocognitive magnitude representations."

# What's in this repository? 
In this reposistory, we provide the code and data for the following: 

**Code** 
1. _R code_ to run hierarchical Bayesian modelling (via R-JAGS)
2. _Log files_ containing for the hierarchical Bayesian models used in the analysis
3. _R code_ on the behavioural analysis such as fitting the psychometric functions, correlations of individual-level data points, mediation analysis, and generating some of the figures

**Data**
1. Trialwise data for hierarchical-Bayesian population-level analysis
2. Individual-level data for correlations 

**Log**
_August 31_: Uploaded the raw code and files. Will have to clean up the code for reader-friendly usage.
